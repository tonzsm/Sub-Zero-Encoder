## üî• Key Features

*   **Seamless Subtitle Integration:** Burn `.ass` and `.srt` subtitles directly into your video files, creating a single, easy-to-share file.
*   **Precision Time Trimming:** Easily trim the start and end times of your video. The tool intelligently handles both video and audio streams to ensure perfect synchronization.
*   **High-Performance Encoding:**
    *   **GPU Acceleration:** Utilizes NVIDIA's NVENC (h264/hevc) for lightning-fast encoding.
    *   **CPU Encoding:** Supports high-quality software encoding with `libx264` and `libx265`.
*   **Smart File Analysis:**
    *   Automatically detects video and audio properties (bitrate, resolution, codecs) to provide intelligent default settings.
    *   Automatically finds matching subtitle files (`.ass` or `.srt`) in the same folder as your video.
*   **Advanced Audio Control:**
    *   Choose to **copy** the original audio for perfect quality when not trimming.
    *   Re-encode audio to popular formats like **AAC** or **AC3** with adjustable bitrate.
*   **Resolution Scaling:** Downscale your 4K videos to 1440p, 1080p, or 720p to save space and ensure compatibility.
*   **Intuitive User Interface:**
    *   Drag & Drop support for video and subtitle files.
