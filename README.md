## ‚ú® Features

Sub-Zero Encoder is packed with features designed to make your workflow as smooth as possible.

*   **Intuitive UI:** A clean and simple graphical user interface.
*   **Drag & Drop:** Full drag and drop support for both video and subtitle files.
*   **Auto-Subtitle Finder:** Automatically detects and loads matching `.ass` or `.srt` subtitle files.
*   **GPU Acceleration:** Utilizes NVIDIA NVENC for blazing-fast encoding speeds.
*   **Standalone & Portable:** Comes bundled with FFmpeg. No external dependencies or installation required. Just extract and run!
*   **Resolution Scaling:** Easily downscale your videos to standard resolutions like 1080p or 720p.
*   **Stable Time Trimming:** Encode only the specific segments you need. The output is **guaranteed** to have perfect audio and subtitle synchronization.
*   **Live Pre-computation:**
    *   **ETA:** Displays the estimated time remaining during the encoding process.
    *   **Estimated File Size:** See the final output file size in real-time as you adjust your settings.
*   **Convenient Output Handling:**
    *   **Open Folder:** Instantly opens the destination folder.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
*   Windows Operating System (7, 10, 11).
*   An **NVIDIA GPU** is required to use the GPU Acceleration mode. The application will still function in CPU mode without it.

### Installation & Usage
1.  Go to the [**Releases**](https://github.com/tonzsm/Sub-Zero-Encoder/releases) page.
2.  Download the latest `.zip` archive (e.g., `Sub-Zero-Encoder.zip`).
3.  Extract the archive to a folder of your choice.
4.  Run `Sub-Zero-Encoder.exe`.
5.  Drag and drop your files or use the "Browse..." buttons.
6.  Adjust your settings and click **Start**!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

*   **Missing Fonts:** The `.ass` subtitle format sometimes requires specific fonts to be installed on your system. If a required font is not found, FFmpeg may throw an error or substitute the font, potentially affecting the subtitle's appearance. **Please ensure you have the necessary fonts installed for best results.**

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

This project is actively developed. Here are some features planned for the future:
- [ ] Batch processing / Queue system
- [ ] Soft-subtitle support (for MKV/MP4)
- [ ] Audio/Subtitle track selection for files with multiple tracks
- [ ] Configuration profiles (Save/Load settings)

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Credits

This application wouldn't be possible without these amazing open-source projects:
*   **FFmpeg:** The core of all video and audio processing.
*   **Python:** The programming language used to build the app.
*   **Tkinter / tkinterdnd2:** For the graphical user interface.
*   **ffmpeg-python:** A helpful Python wrapper for FFmpeg.
